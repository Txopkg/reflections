When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working together with other people so that them can work form their own computer and me from mine.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I donÂ´t know what to answer here...
